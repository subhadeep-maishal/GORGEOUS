Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as transformative tools in the realm of ocean and climate change research, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI). Their influence extends beyond traditional applications, ushering in a new era of progress in generating realistic climate data, fostering breakthroughs in generative models, and enhancing the capabilities of unsupervised learning methodologies. GANs play a pivotal role in simulating complex environmental scenarios, contributing to a deeper understanding of oceanic and climatic phenomena.
